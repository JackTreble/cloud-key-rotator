# CircleCI Example

## Pre-requisites

In order to enable rotation + update of a secret that's stored in CircleCI
env vars, you'll need:

1. A GitHub user (preferably a dedicated machine-user, rather than a human's)
with write access to the GitHub repository that the CircleCI project is linked to.
2. A CircleCI API key for the GitHub user, which can be generated by logging in
to [circleci.com](circleci.com) as the user, then creating a [personal API token](https://circleci.com/account/api).
3. Auth to actually perform the rotation operation with whichever cloud provider
you're using. This will require a service-account or user (with the cloud-provider you're rotating with) that has the required set of permissions. Then, auth will
need to be given to `cloud-key-rotator` (usually in the form of a .json file or
env vars).

## Configuration

In config, you may be setting something like this:

```json
"CircleCI": [{
  "UsernameProject": "ovotech/project_name",
  "KeyIDEnvVar": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
  "KeyEnvVar": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
}]
```

This example is specific to AWS, for which you'll be storing both the access key
ID and the secret access Key.

For other providers, where you may only wish to store the key itself (and not
the ID), you can omit the `KeyIDEnvVar` field. E.g.:

```json
"CircleCI": [{
  "UsernameProject": "ovotech/project_name",
  "KeyEnvVar": "GCP_KEY_JSON"
}]
```
